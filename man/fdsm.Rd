\title{Depricated function to extract Fixed Degree Sequence Model (FDSM) backbone}
\usage{
fdsm(
  B,
  alpha = 0.05,
  missing.as.zero = FALSE,
  signed = FALSE,
  mtc = "none",
  narrative = FALSE,
  trials = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{B}{An unweighted bipartite network as a binary incidence matrix or a binary bipartite \link[igraph]{igraph} object}

\item{alpha}{real: significance level of hypothesis test(s)}

\item{missing.as.zero}{boolean: treat missing edges as edges with zero weight and test them for significance}

\item{signed}{boolean: return a signed backbone}

\item{mtc}{string: type of Multiple Test Correction, either \code{"none"} or a method allowed by \code{\link[=p.adjust]{p.adjust()}}.}

\item{narrative}{boolean: display suggested text & citations}

\item{trials}{numeric: the number of bipartite graphs generated using fastball to approximate the edge weight distribution}
