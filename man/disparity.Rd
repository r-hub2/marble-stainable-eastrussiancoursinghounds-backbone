\title{Depricated function to extract disparity filter backbone}
\usage{
disparity(
  W,
  alpha = 0.05,
  missing.as.zero = FALSE,
  signed = FALSE,
  mtc = "none",
  narrative = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{W}{A positively-weighted unipartite graph as a binary incidence matrix or a binary bipartite \link[igraph]{igraph} object}

\item{alpha}{real: significance level of hypothesis test(s)}

\item{missing.as.zero}{boolean: should missing edges be treated as edges with zero weight and tested for significance}

\item{signed}{boolean: TRUE for a signed backbone, FALSE for a binary backbone (see details)}

\item{mtc}{string: type of Multiple Test Correction to be applied; can be any method allowed by \code{\link[=p.adjust]{p.adjust()}}.}

\item{narrative}{boolean: TRUE if suggested text & citations should be displayed.
